# Higher-Order-Function
There are some functions which known as `Higher Order Function / Methods`

## 1: map()

The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element and
the `map()` method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.
## Note: 
This method does not change the original array.

## 2: filter()

The `filter()` method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).
## Note:
This method does not change the original array.

## 3: sort()

By default, the `sort()` function sorts values as strings.

## 4: forEach()

The `forEach()` method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.
## Note: 
The function is not executed for array elements without values.

## 5: reduce()

The `reduce()` method reduces the array to a single value and the `reduce()` method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).

### Syntax

```ruby 
array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)
```
